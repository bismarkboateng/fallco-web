        Keele Universitys Dr Anja Winter has received a prestigious grant to investigate severe joint pain in patients infected with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). 
        Chikungunya virus is a rapidly spreading infectious disease prevalent in large parts of the tropics and subtropic regions, and although the resulting acute infection is generally non-fatal, it frequently evolves into a long-lasting, debilitating disorder similar to rheumatoid arthritis. 
        This new research aims to understand the biological processes that lead to this chronic arthritis, which will help with the development of new treatments and therapies. 
        HELPING TO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS 
        Patients who suffer from debilitating joint pain following a tropical viral infection are set to benefit from new Keele University research. 
        
        Dr Anja Winter from Keele University’s School of Life Sciences has received a prestigious Springboard grant from the Academy of Medical Sciences, to investigate severe joint pain in patients infected with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).  
        
        The aim of the research is to aid development of new treatments and pain management techniques, which could also benefit those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. 
        
        DEBILITATING AFTER-EFFECTS 
        Chikungunya virus is a rapidly spreading infectious disease that has attracted global attention due to its prevalence in large parts of the tropics and subtropic regions. Although the resulting acute infection is generally non-fatal, it frequently evolves into a long-lasting, debilitating disorder similar to rheumatoid arthritis.  
        
        The severe joint pain caused by CHIKV infection has a major impact on patients’ quality of life, forcing them to reduce their daily activities and in some cases give up their jobs. This in turn leads to depression, loss of earnings, and social exclusion in already deprived regions of the world. 
        
        STUDYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS 
        Dr Winter’s research will study the crucial biological processes that lead to this chronic arthritis, which in turn will drive new clinical treatments. The project will use cutting-edge techniques to study the mechanisms leading to chronic CHIKV infection and enable research into effective treatments, specifically looking at changes in joints and their implications for joint inflammation and degradation.  
        
        Due to their similarities with rheumatoid arthritis, these could also inform new treatments for that disease as well.  
        
        Dr Winter said:  "Patients who suffer from this debilitating disease following a CHIKV infection not only have to deal with the painful physical consequences, but can also be forced to give up their jobs due to the pain and miss out on daily activities, severely impacting their quality of life. Through this study we hope to learn more about the fundamental biological processes that cause this painful arthritis, so that we can lay the foundations for new treatments that help these patients lead fulfilling and enjoyable lives."
